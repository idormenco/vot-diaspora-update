Vot Diaspora is a platform that simplifies the electoral guide for the 6th of December elections for citizens. Vot Diaspora is Code for Romania's first ever project, starting with 2016, in order to facilitate access to electoral information for Romanians abroad and foster a more transparent process. 25% of all voters abroad used the app for the 2019 European Parliament elections and over 185.000 voters used it at the 2019 presidential elections.

[See the project live](https://votdiaspora.ro/en)

By accessing votdiaspora.ro, all citizens can check the required documents for voting, the correct procedures for voting either at polling stations or via mail-in ballot and their alotted polling station and the closest route. The Website will be available and updated for each new round of elections. All content available on the Vot Diaspora platform is done in collaboration with Observatorul Electoral electoral experts.
